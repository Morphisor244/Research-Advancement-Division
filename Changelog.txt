**Version 1.0.0
- Initial release
- 5 contracts and a new agent with custom logo included

**Version 1.0.1
- Folder structure fixed

**Version 1.1.0
- Added contract Local Observation Flight: large set of experiments in flight, for a single biome
- Changed Leftovers contract to only request experiments from a single situation instead of a mix. Beware, this may reduce ability for the contract to generate.
- Minor improvements to subject selection logic

**Version 1.2.0
- Added contract Surface analysis: smaller set of experiments than the existing surface study, but spread out over 2 biomes instead. Goal is to allow for smaller craft(probes) to be more feasible for surface missions.

**Version 1.2.1
- Improved Local Observation flight subject selection logic to hopefully avoid requesting impossible experiments
- Changed max simultaneous contracts to 7, matching the number of available contract types.

**Version 1.2.2
- Fixed the surface study contract, there will no longer be duplicates and everything should be smooth sailing now.
- Added minimum number of experiments requirement to all contracts, should make generation a bit more consistent.

**Version 1.3.0
- Improved biome selection logic for contracts that select multiple biomes (Orbital biome observation, Atmospheric investigation, Surface analysis).
- This also makes the contract look better in mission control: subjects are ordered by biome and easier to differentiate.
- Lowered minimum remaining science for these contracts to generate more often.
- Tuned the experiment/subject numbers a bit.
